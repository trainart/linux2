Linux Boot Process generally include following steps:

1. After "Power ON", the hardware runs the firmware - <br>**BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) <br>or<br> **UEFI** (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). 
<br><br> **BIOS** / **UEFI** does the following: 
   1. Performs hardware checks - **POST** (Power-On Self-Test)
   2. Loads bootloader - **GRUB** (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader)
      1. **BIOS** → **MBR**
      2. **UEFI** → **GPT** 
2. Bootloader **GRUB** does the following:
   1. Provides menu to select boot system
   2. Loads the system - Linux kernel (PID 0).
3. Linux kernel (PID 0) does the System Initialization, which includes:
   1. Hardware checks on kernel level
   2. Starts the main Initialization Process - **SystemD** / **INIT** (PID 1) 
4. The main Initialization Process - **SystemD** / **INIT** (PID 1) does the following:
   1. Bring system to `default.target` / `default runlevel` , which includes:
      1. Mounting the filesystems
      2. Start different services
      3. Initialize user sessions



Linux system initialization for a long time was handled by the _Unix-inspired SystemV_ **init** 
process, which ran scripts to start services in a defined and configurable order to reach a 
series of states, called **runlevels**. 

Current most popular initialization system for Linux is **SystemD**. 
It is more flexible and modular. 

First initialization process (PID 1) (**SystemD** / **INIT**) manages: 
* startup process
* services running (enable/disable, start/stop)
* shutdown process

**SystemD** uses **targets** instead of **runlevels** to define the state of the system. 

Goal of **runlevels**/**targets** is to process system initialization 
and bring the Linux system to specific state.

By default, there are two main targets:

**multi-user.target** <-> **runlevel 3**

**graphical.target** <-> **runlevel 5**


To check the default target, which determines what services are started during boot, we can run:

```bash
systemctl get-default
```

To change to text mode we can run (same as `init 3`):

```bash
systemctl isolate multi-user.target 
```


To change to graphical mode we can run (same as `init 5`):

```bash
systemctl isolate graphical.target
```

If we want to permanently set default to text mode (to work after reboot) we can run:

```bash
systemctl set-default multi-user.target 
```

Now we can reboot:

```bash
reboot
```

> 
> Old alternative to `reboot` is `init 6` and it still works
> Old alternative to `poweroff` is `init 0` and it still works
 

You can also list the dependencies of a target
(to see which units run certain target):

```bash
systemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target
```
You may see different colors:
* **Green** - unit is active/running.
* **White**/**gray** - unit is inactive/not running.
* **Red** - unit failed to run.


`systemctl` is a powerful command-line tool for managing `systemd`-driven Linuxes. 
It's a **system** and **service** manager for Linux. More details are below.


Table below presents **SystemV runlevel** and **SystemD target** equivalents.

| SystemV Runlevel | SystemD equivalent | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 (HALT)|poweroff.target |Shuts down the system |
| 1 (SINGLE-USER MODE) | rescue.target | Mode for administrative and system rescue tasks. Only the root user can log in. |
| 2 (MULTI-USER MODE) | | All users can log in, but network interfaces aren’t configured and networks services are not exported. Display manager is not started. |
| 3 (MULTI-USER MODE WITH NETWORKING) | **multi-user.target** | Starts the system normally. Display manager is not started. |
| 5 (START THE SYSTEM NORMALLY WITH APPROPRIATE DISPLAY MANAGER (WITHGUI)) | **graphical.target** | Same as runlevel 3, but with a display manager.|
| 6 (REBOOT) | reboot.target | Reboots the system.|

Old way to understand where you are was:

```bash
runlevel
```

It shows current and previous runlevel.




**Note:** Previous Linux versions, which were distributed with **SystemV init** ,
used init scripts located in the `/etc/rc.d/init.d/` directory. 

These **init** scripts were typically written in Bash, and allowed the system 
administrator to control the state of services and daemons in their system.

**SystemD** still can also run old _SystemV_ **init** scripts.

But **SystemD** driven systems have init scripts replaced with **service units**. 
**Service units** end with the **.service** file extension and serve a 
similar purpose as init scripts.

To view, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `enable`, or `disable` system services, use the `systemctl` command as described below. 

Old `service` and `chkconfig` commands are still available in some versions 
and work as expected, but are only included for compatibility reasons 
and better to be avoided. 

**Note**
When working with system services, it is possible to omit this file `.service` unit
extension to reduce typing. When the `systemctl` utility encounters a unit name without a file extension, 
it automatically assumes it is a `.service` unit. 

For example: 

`systemctl status rsyslog.service`

is the same as:

`systemctl status rsyslog`


### PRACTICE

#### Find out which initialization process (with PID **1**) is running in your Linux.
_HINT:_ You need to run command that shows all processes in **tree-like** manner and see the name of top process.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Service Management:

1. List all services on your system.

```bash
systemctl 
```

2. List the running services on your system.

```bash
systemctl | grep running
```

3. Check to see if the service (daemon) is running on your system. 

```bash
systemctl | grep cron
```

4. Restart, Stop, Start the service.

```bash
systemctl restart crond
```

```bash
systemctl stop crond
```

```bash
systemctl start crond
```

5. Disable/Enable the service start automatically at boot time.

```bash
systemctl is-enabled crond
```

```bash
systemctl disable crond
```

```bash
systemctl is-enabled crond
```

```bash
systemctl enable crond
```

```bash
systemctl is-enabled crond
```

6. Reboot & shutdown the system

You can reboot with you can either run

```bash
reboot
```

or

```bash
init 6
```

You can shutdown with either

```bash
poweroff
```

or

```bash
init 0
```


> INTERESTING NOTE: 
> 
> Look at output of `ls -l /usr/sbin/reboot`
> 
> Look at output of `ls -l /usr/sbin/poweroff`

#### Service Configuration files

To see configuration of some service we can use `cat` keyword:

```bash
systemctl cat sshd
```

```bash
systemctl cat crond
```

#### Enable additional terminal configuration

After Linux system boots by default it enables about 6 terminal sessions on F1-F6 keys.

But we can add new terminal sessions.

For example, to immediately start new terminal on F12 run

```bash
systemctl start getty@tty12.service
```

Now try to login from `F12` terminal and after login type `w` or `tty`, to see your terminal name.


But the above will not remain after reboot.

We can enable that service

```bash
systemctl enable getty@tty12.service
```

Or we can do both at the same time.
Below will enable and immediately start new terminal on F10 run

```bash
systemctl enable --now getty@tty10.service
```


> Other way is to configure `systemd-logind` process, that manages user logins. 
> If we want more virtual terminals we can edit `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` and add or modify line:
> `NAutoVTs=12`, which will enable terminal to all F1-F12 keys.



### PRACTICE

Create you own startup test service, that will run for `multi-user.target`.

```bash
cat  > /etc/systemd/system/startuptest.service  << "LASTLINE"
[Unit]
Description=Startup Test Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/startuptest.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
LASTLINE

```

Check its contents 

```bash
systemctl cat startuptest
```

Create script mentioned in the service.

```bash
cat  > /opt/startuptest.sh  << "FINISH"
#!/bin/bash
echo "$(date) - Linux server $(hostname) started !" >> /var/log/startuptest.log
FINISH

chmod +x /opt/startuptest.sh

```

Now enable it to run at startup:

```bash
systemctl enable startuptest
```

Check:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled startuptest
```

Test run without restart
```bash
systemctl start startuptest
```

Check log file
```bash
cat /var/log/startuptest.log
```

Check in the list
```bash
systemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target | grep startuptest
```

Reboot

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

Login and check log file again.
You should see **one more line** from last startup.

```bash
cat /var/log/startuptest.log
```

## Recovering root password

Below is important way to recover root password.
While booting the server you should interrupt normal boot and do the following steps.

1. Press `Esc` to prevent GRUB automatic system load. Ensure first line is selected
at the GRUB prompt and press `e`
2. Scroll down and locate kernel arguments line (starting with `linux` or similiar and
 having generally `rhgb quiet` keywords. Move your cursor ( HINT: move to end of the line with CTRL+E ) on `rhgb quiet` keywords and replace them with `init=/bin/bash`
3. Press `Ctrl X` to boot with custom parameters. Kernel will boot and run single **bash** process. 
To make changes you need to remount root partition, since it is now mounted
in _read-only_ mode. In order to mount root partition with read/write flag 
we need to remount it as follows: `mount -o remount,rw /`
4. Now **any** changes can be done, like root password change with `passwd`
5. **IMPORTANT !** This additional step needs to be taken on SELinux-enabled systems to relabel SELinux context. 
   * Check  `cat /etc/selinux/config  | grep ^SELINUX=`  (if you don't get any lines as result it means this option is commented).
      if this option is set to `permissive`or `disabled`, you can omit this step.
      But if it is set to `enforcing`, then this step is very important. If not done **you will not be able to login**. 
      What you need to do is run the command:

   ```bash
   touch /.autorelabel
   ```
    It will ensure that the SELinux context for entire system is relabeled after reboot. So you can boot normally.

6. Final important step is to `sync` the changes on disk. After that we can simply
power off the system (_no need to reboot, since there is no process which can do rebooting_)
  
_Same way can be used to do needed maintenance (eg. `fsck /dev/sda1` )_

### How to Password Protect GRUB2 Boot Loader

Use `grub2-setpassword` to set a password for the `root` user (_it's not Linux `root`_)
```bash
grub2-setpassword
```
This creates a file `/boot/grub2/user.cfg` if not already present, 
which contains the hashed GRUB bootloader password. 
This utility only supports configurations where there is a single root user.

This protection prevents unauthorized users from:
* Editing boot parameters (pressing 'e')
* Accessing GRUB command line 
* Booting into recovery/single-user modes

To remove GRUB password-protect from boot menu, simply delete the file `/boot/grub2/user.cfg`

### Manage the Boot Process (GRUB2)

GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader 2) is the default bootloader on most modern Linux systems.

It controls:
* Which OS/kernel boots by default 
* Boot arguments (e.g., enabling rescue mode)
* Timeout before auto-booting

Key files:

* `/etc/default/grub` – Main settings (timeout, default OS, etc.)

* `/etc/grub.d/` – Scripts generating boot entries

* `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` – Final config (automatically generated, **do not edit directly**!)



#### Simple Example: Changing Boot Timeout

Goal: Change the boot menu timeout from `5s` to `10s`.

Step 1: Edit /etc/default/grub

Open `/etc/default/grub`
```bash
nano /etc/default/grub
```

Change `GRUB_TIMEOUT=5` to `GRUB_TIMEOUT=10` and save the file.


Step 2: Regenerate grub.cfg

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

Step 3: Verify Changes

We now search in newly generated config if our changes applied:

```bash
grep "timeout" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

If you see `set timeout=2`, then it is ok.
We can reboot to see the effect

```bash
reboot
```

Important Notes:

* Never edit `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` directly – Changes will be lost on update!

* Test changes before rebooting (use grep as shown above).

* For kernel arguments, modify `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub`.
